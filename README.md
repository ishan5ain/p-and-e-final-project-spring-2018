# Data Privacy: Measuring Digital Footprints

## Summary

An Installation that makes people more aware about their data privacy and artistically represents their digital footprint.

## Context
Every day, whether we want to or not, most of us contribute to a growing portrait of who we are online; a portrait that is probably more public than we assume.
This portrait helps companies target content at specific markets and consumers, helps employers look into your background, and helps advertisers track your movements across multiple websites. Whatever we do online, we might be leaving our digital footprints behind.

Your digital footprint paints a picture of who you are and its unique to every individual.
Surprisingly very few people are aware about it. It's important to be conscious of the impact and the consequences of the footprint you leave behind.
This installation aims at making people more conscious about their online activity. It also gives a artistic representation to a personâ€™s intangible digital footprint.
